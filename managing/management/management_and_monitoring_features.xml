	<title>Management and Monitoring Features</title>
	<shortdesc><keyword keyref="product_name_long"/> uses a federated Open MBean strategy to manage
		and monitor all members of the distributed system. This strategy gives you a consolidated,
		single-agent view of the distributed system. </shortdesc>

			<p>Application and manager development is much easier because you do not have to find
				the right MBeanServer to make a request on an MBean. Instead, you interact with a
				single MBeanServer that aggregates MBeans from all other local and remote
				MBeanServers. </p>
			<p>Some other key advantages and features of <keyword keyref="product_name"/>

						monitoring is tightly integrated into <keyword keyref="product_name"/>'s
						processes instead of running in a separately installed and configured
						monitoring agent. You can use the same framework to actually manage <keyword
							keyref="product_name"/> and perform administrative operations, not just
						monitor it. </li>
					<li id="li_6767866D95F1452585CDF2350FC96941">All <keyword keyref="product_name"
						/> MBeans are <i>MXBeans</i>. They represent useful and relevant information
						on the state of the distributed system and all its members. Because MXBeans
						use the Open MBean model with a predefined set of types, clients and remote
						management programs no longer require access to model-specific classes
						representing your MBean types. Using MXBeans adds flexibility to your
						selection of clients and makes the <keyword keyref="product_name"/>
						management and monitoring much easier to use. </li>
					<li id="li_A6ADFA38EC064937A14A5B6074DEDEB4">Each member in the distributed
						system is manageable through MXBeans, and each member hosts its own MXBeans
						in a Platform MBeanServer. </li>
					<li id="li_0644006C2BF5411FB0721F6C64C1A2A5">Any <keyword keyref="product_name"
						/> member can be configured to provide a federated view of all the MXBeans
						for all members in a <keyword keyref="product_name"/> cluster. </li>
					<li id="li_C8C0DE4906FC4CD49E8E1C539F73B239"><keyword keyref="product_name"/>
						has also modified its use of JMX to be industry-standard and friendly to
						generic JMX clients. You can now easily monitor or manage the distributed
						system by using any third-party tool that is compliant with JMX. For
						example, JConsole. </li>
