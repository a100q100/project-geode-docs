	<title>How Statistics Work</title>
	<shortdesc>Each application or cache server that joins the distributed system can collect and
		archive statistical data for analyzing system performance. </shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<section id="section_C12B3CDFF04743688BA5F8FB374899D5">
			<p>Set the configuration attributes that control statistics collection in
					<codeph>gfsh</codeph> or in the <codeph>gemfire.properties</codeph>
				configuration file. You can also collect your own application defined
				statistics.</p>
			<p>When Java applications and servers join a distributed system, they can be configured
				via the cluster configuration service to enable statistics sampling and whether to
				archive the statistics that are gathered. </p>
			<note>

					statistics use the Java <codeph>System.nanoTimer</codeph> for nanosecond timing.
					This method provides nanosecond precision, but not necessarily nanosecond
					accuracy. For more information, see the online Java documentation for
						<codeph>System.nanoTimer</codeph> for the JRE you are using with <keyword
						keyref="product_name"/>.
				</p>
			</note>
			<p>Statistics sampling provides valuable information for ongoing system tuning and
				troubleshooting. Sampling statistics (not including time-based statistics) at the
				default sample rate does not impact overall distributed system performance. We
				recommend enabling statistics sampling in production environments. We do not
				recommend enabling time-based statistics (configured with the enable-time-statistics
				property) in production environments.</p>
