  <title>Viewing Archived Statistics</title>
  <conbody><p>When sampling and archiving are enabled, you can examine archived historical data to help
      diagnose performance problems.  Study statistics in archive files by using the gfsh
        <codeph>show metrics</codeph> command. You may also wish to use a separate statistics
      display utility, such as <xref href="../../tools_modules/jvsd.xml"/>. </p></conbody>
