  <title>TCP/IP KeepAlive Configuration</title>
  <shortdesc><keyword keyref="product_name"/> supports TCP KeepAlive to prevent socket connections
    from being timed out. </shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>The <codeph>gemfire.enableTcpKeepAlive</codeph> system property prevents connections that
      appear idle from being timed out (for example, by a firewall.) When configured to true,
        <keyword keyref="product_name"/> enables the SO_KEEPALIVE option for individual sockets.
      This operating system-level setting allows the socket to send verification checks (ACK
      requests) to remote systems in order to determine whether or not to keep the socket connection
      alive. </p>
      <note>The time intervals for sending the first ACK KeepAlive request, the subsequent ACK
        requests and the number of requests to send before closing the socket is configured on the
        operating system level.</note>
    <p>By default, this system property is set to true.</p>
