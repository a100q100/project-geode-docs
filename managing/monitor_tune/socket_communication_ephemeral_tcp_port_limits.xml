	<title>Ephemeral TCP Port Limits</title>
	<shortdesc>By default, Windowsâ€™ ephemeral ports are within the range 1024-4999, inclusive.You
		can increase the range. </shortdesc>

			<p> If you are repeatedly receiving the following exception: </p>
				<codeblock>java.net.BindException: Address already in use: connect</codeblock>
			<p>and if your system is experiencing a high degree of network activity, such as
				numerous short-lived client connections, this could be related to a limit on the
				number of ephemeral TCP ports. While this issue could occur with other operating
				systems, typically, it is only seen with Windows due to a low default limit. </p>
			<p>Perform this procedure to increase the limit: </p>

			<p><b>Note for UDP on Unix Systems</b>
			</p>
			<p>Unix systems have a default maximum socket buffer size for receiving UDP multicast
				and unicast transmissions that is lower than the default settings for
				mcast-recv-buffer-size and udp-recv-buffer-size. To achieve high-volume multicast
				messaging, you should increase the maximum Unix buffer size to at least one
				megabyte. </p>
