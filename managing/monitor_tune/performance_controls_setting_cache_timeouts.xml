	<title>Setting Cache Timeouts</title>
	<shortdesc>Cache timeout properties can modified through the gfsh <codeph>alter runtime</codeph>
		command (or declared in the <codeph>cache.xml</codeph> file) and can also be set through
		methods of the interface, <codeph>com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.Cache</codeph>. </shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p>To modify cache timeout properties, you can issue the following <codeph>gfsh alter
			runtime</codeph> command. For example:</p>
			<codeblock>gfsh>alter runtime --search-timeout=150</codeblock>
		<p>The
				<codeph>--search-timeout</codeph> parameter specifies how long a netSearch operation
			can wait for data before timing out. The default is 5 minutes. You may want to change
			this based on your knowledge of the network load or other factors. </p>
		<p>The next two configurations describe timeout settings for locking in regions with global
			scope. Locking operations can time out in two places: when waiting to obtain a lock
			(lock time out); and when holding a lock (lock lease time). Operations that modify
			objects in a global region use automatic locking. In addition, you can manually lock a
			global region and its entries through
			<codeph>com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.Region</codeph>. The explicit lock methods provided
			by the APIs allow you to specify a lock timeout parameter. The lock time out for
			implicit operations and the lock lease time for implicit and explicit operations are
			governed by these cache-wide settings: </p>
		<codeblock>gfsh>alter runtime --lock-timeout=30 --lock-lease=60</codeblock>
		<ul id="ul_A6436C81996944DA92386805F5FEC657">
			<li id="li_947EAE03C837483A90CFAD434C457C3C"><codeph>--lock-timeout</codeph>. Timeout
				for object lock requests, specified in seconds. The setting affects automatic
				locking only, and does not apply to manual locking. The default is 1 minute. If a
				lock request does not return before the specified timeout period, it is cancelled
				and returns with a failure. </li>
			<li id="li_16800D4D204644F2A0370CF14AFFD50D"><codeph>--lock-lease</codeph>. Timeout for
				object lock leases, specified in seconds. The setting affects both automatic locking
				and manual locking. The default is 2 minutes. Once a lock is obtained, it may remain
				in force for the lock lease time period before being automatically cleared by the
				system. </li>
		</ul>
