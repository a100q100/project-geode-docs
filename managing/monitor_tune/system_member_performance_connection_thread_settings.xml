		<p> This property controls the number of threads that can be used to establish new TCP/IP
			connections between peer caches. The threads are discarded if they are idle for 60
			seconds. </p>
		<p>The default value for p2p.HANDSHAKE_POOL_SIZE is 10. This command-line specification sets
			the number of threads to 100: </p>
