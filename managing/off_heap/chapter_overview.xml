	<title>Using Off-Heap Memory</title>
	<shortdesc>Large quantities of memory outside the control of the Java garbage collector may be used
		for region data values by enabling the off-heap feature.</shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p>Garbage collection within a JVM can prove to be a performance impediment. A server cannot exert
			control over when garbage collection takes place, and the server has little control over
			the triggers for invocation.</p>
		<p><keyword keyref="product_name"/> can be configured to store region values in off-heap
			memory, which is memory within the JVM that is not subject to garbage collection.
				<keyword keyref="product_name"/>'s own slab memory manager efficiently handles the
			off-heap memory.</p>
		<p>Meant for data values that are all the same size, because the slab manager works best
			with same-sized data. The ideal application for off-heap memory creates and destroys or
			clears region values.  It does not update values, as this requires deserialization and
			movement of the values, incurring a performance hit.</p>
