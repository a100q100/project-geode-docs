	<title>Cache and Region Snapshots</title>
	<shortdesc>Snapshots allow you to save region data and reload it later. A typical use case is
		loading data from one environment into another, such as capturing data from a production
		system and moving it into a smaller QA or development system. </shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p> In effect, you can load data from one distributed system into another distributed
			system. Administrators export a snapshot of a region or an entire cache (multiple
			regions) and later import the snapshot into another region or distributed system by
			using the <codeph>RegionSnapshotService</codeph> or
				<codeph>CacheSnapshotService</codeph> interface and the
				<codeph>Region.getSnapshotService</codeph> or
				<codeph>Cache.getSnapshotService</codeph> method. </p>
		<p>The snapshot file is a binary file that contains all data from a particular region. The
			binary format contains serialized key/value pairs and supports PDX type registry to
			allow the deserialization of PDX data. The snapshot can be directly imported into a
			region or read entry-by-entry for further processing or transformation into other
			formats. </p>
			<note>The previous <codeph>Region.loadSnapshot</codeph> and
					<codeph>Region.saveSnapshot</codeph> APIs have been deprecated. Data written in
				this format is not compatible with the new APIs. </note>
