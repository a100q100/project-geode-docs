			<title>Cache Consistency and Concurrent Operations</title>
			<p> Importing and exporting region data is an administrative operation, and certain
				simultaneous runtime conditions can cause the import or export operation to fail
				such as when you are rebalancing partitioned region buckets or experience a network
				partition event. This behavior is expected, and you should retry the operation.
				Redoing an export overwrites an incomplete snapshot file, and redoing an import
				updates partially imported data. </p>
			<p>The snapshot feature does not guarantee consistency. Concurrent cache operations
				during a snapshot import or export can cause data consistency issues. If snapshot
				consistency is important, Pivotal recommends that you take your application offline
				before export and import, to provide a quiet period ensures data consistency in your
				snapshot. </p>
			<p>For example, modifications to region entries during an export can result in a
				snapshot that contains some but not all updates. If entries { A, B } are updated to
				{ A', B'} during the export, the snapshot can contain { A, B' } depending on the
				write order. Also, modifications to region entries during an import can cause lost
				updates in the cache. If the region contains entries { A, B } and the snapshot
				contains { A', B' }, concurrent updates { A*, B* } can result in the region
				containing { A*, B' } after the import completes. </p>
			<p>The default behavior is to perform all I/O operations on the node where the snapshot
				operations are invoked. This will involve either collecting or dispersing data over
				the network if the region is a partitioned region. </p>

			<title>Performance Considerations</title>
			<p> When using the data snapshot feature, be aware of the following performance
				considerations: <ul id="ul_2C5A5E07DB15471FA8708FE0F2432E0D">
					<li id="li_40AFF618B34842BB95BA346F00B647F4">Importing and exporting cache or
						region snapshots causes additional CPU and network load. You may need to
						increase CPU capacity or network bandwidth depending on your applications
						and infrastructure. In addition, if you export regions that have been
						configured to overflow to disk, you may require additional disk I/O to
						perform the export. </li>
					<li id="li_6C1CA5060C764A4190396010BAD0C253">When exporting partitioned region
						data, allocate additional heap memory so the member performing the export
						can buffer data gathered from other cache members. Allocate at least 10MB
						per member to your heap in addition to whatever configuration is necessary
						to support your application or cache. </li>
				</ul>
