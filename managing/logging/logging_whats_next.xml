			<title>Log File Naming Recommendation</title>
			<p> For members running on the same machine, you can have them log to their own files by
				starting them in different working directories and using the same, relative
					<codeph>log-file</codeph> specification. For example, you could set this in
					<codeph>&lt;commonDirectoryPath&gt;/gemfire.properties</codeph>:
				<codeblock>log-file=./log/member.log</codeblock>then start each member in a
				different directory with this command, which points to the common properties file:
				<codeblock>java -DgemfirePropertyFile=&lt;commonDirectoryPath&gt;/gemfire.properties</codeblock>This
				way, each member has its own log files under its own working directory. </p>

			<title>Searching the Log Files</title>
			<p>For the clearest picture, merge the log files, with the <codeph>gfsh export
					logs</codeph> command:
				<codeblock>gfsh> export logs --dir=myDir --dir=myDir --merge-log=true</codeblock>
			</p>
			<p>Search for lines that begin with these strings: </p>
				<ul
					id="ul_C839BC67136C45C5B77676F38D5F3705">

			<title>Creating Your Own Log Messages</title>
			<p>In addition to the system logs, you can add your own application logs from your Java
				code. For information on adding custom logging to your applications, see the online
				Java documentation for the <codeph>com.gemstone.gemfire.LogWriter</codeph>
				interface. Both system and application logging is output and stored according to
				your logging configuration settings. </p>
