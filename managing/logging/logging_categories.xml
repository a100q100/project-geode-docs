			<p>Specify your <keyword keyref="product_name"/> system member's main log in the gemfire

			<p><keyword keyref="product_name"/> uses this name for the most recent log file,
				actively in use if the member is running, or used for the last run. <keyword
					keyref="product_name"/> creates the main log file when the application starts. </p>
			<p>By default, the main log contains the entire log for the member session. If you
				specify a <codeph>log-file-size-limit</codeph>, <keyword keyref="product_name"/>
				splits the logging into these files:</p>
					<ul id="ul_F0B11A5026AC4419AB879A0A983BAC49">
					<li id="li_5DC487D51234406CB24CB1DCE67335CA"><b>The main, current log</b>.

					<li id="li_5053B42B4D3747CA9B2A83C93B950870"><b>Child logs</b>. Holding older

						operations </li>
					</ul>
			<p>The current log is renamed, or rolled, to the next available child log when the
				specified size limit is reached. </p>
			<p>When your application connects with logging enabled, it creates the main log file
				and, if required, the <codeph>meta-</codeph> log file. If the main log file is
				present when the member starts up, it is renamed to the next available child log to
				make way for new logging. </p>
			<p>Your current, main log file always has the name you specified in
					<codeph>log-file</codeph>. The old log files and child log files have names
				derived from the main log file name. These are the pieces of a renamed log or child
				log file name where <codeph>filename.extension</codeph> is the
					<codeph>log-file</codeph> specification </p>

			</p>
			<p>If child logs are not used, the child file sequence number is a constant 00 (two
				zeros). </p>
			<p>For locators, the log file name is fixed. For the standalone locator started in
					<codeph>gfsh</codeph>, it is always named <codeph>&lt;locator_name>.log</codeph>
				where the locator_name corresponds to the name specified at locator startup. For the
				locator that runs colocated inside another member, the log file is the memberâ€™s log
				file. </p>
			<p>For applications and the servers, your log file specification can be relative or
				absolute. If no file is specified, the defaults are standard output for applications
				and <codeph>&lt;server_name>.log</codeph> for servers started with gfsh and
					<codeph>cacheserver.log</codeph> for servers started with the older cacheserver
				script. </p>
			<p>To figure out the member's most recent activities, look at the <codeph>meta-</codeph>
				log file or, if no meta file exists, the main log file. </p>

			<title>How the System Renames Logs</title>
			<p>The log file that you specify is the base name used for all logging and logging
				archives. If a log file with the specified name already exists at startup, the
				distributed system automatically renames it before creating the current log file.
				This is a typical directory listing after a few runs with
					<codeph>log-file=system.log</codeph>:
				<codeblock>bash-2.05$ ls -tlra system* 
-rw-rw-r-- 1 jpearson users 11106 Nov 3 11:07 system-01-00.log 
-rw-rw-r-- 1 jpearson users 11308 Nov 3 11:08 system-02-00.log 
-rw-rw-r-- 1 jpearson users 11308 Nov 3 11:09 system.log 
bash-2.05$</codeblock>The
				first run created <codeph>system.log</codeph> with a timestamp of Nov 3 11:07. The
				second run renamed that file to <codeph>system-01-00.log</codeph> and created a new
					<codeph>system.log</codeph> with a timestamp of Nov 3 11:08. The third run
				renamed that file to <codeph>system-02-00.log</codeph> and created the file named
					<codeph>system.log</codeph> in this listing. </p>
			<p>When the distributed system renames the log file, it assigns the next available
				number to the new file, as XX of <codeph>filename-XX-YY.extension</codeph>. This
				next available number depends on existing old log files and also on any old
				statistics archives. The system assigns the next number that is higher than any in
				use for statistics or logging. This keeps current log files and statistics archives
				paired up regardless of the state of the older files in the directory. Thus, if an
				application is archiving statistics and logging to <codeph>system.log</codeph> and
					<codeph>statArchive.gfs</codeph>, and it runs in a Unix directory with these
				files:
				<codeblock>bash-2.05$ ls -tlr stat* system* 
-rw-rw-r-- 1 jpearson users 56143 Nov 3 11:07 statArchive-01-00.gfs 
-rw-rw-r-- 1 jpearson users 56556 Nov 3 11:08 statArchive-02-00.gfs 
-rw-rw-r-- 1 jpearson users 56965 Nov 3 11:09 statArchive-03-00.gfs 
-rw-rw-r-- 1 jpearson users 11308 Nov 3 11:27 system-01-00.log 
-rw-rw-r-- 1 jpearson users 59650 Nov 3 11:34 statArchive.gfs 
-rw-rw-r-- 1 jpearson users 18178 Nov 3 11:34 system.log</codeblock>
				the directory contents after the run look like this (changed files in <b>bold</b>):
				<codeblock>bash-2.05$ ls -ltr stat* system* 
-rw-rw-r-- 1 jpearson users 56143 Nov 3 11:07 statArchive-01-00.gfs 
-rw-rw-r-- 1 jpearson users 56556 Nov 3 11:08 statArchive-02-00.gfs 
-rw-rw-r-- 1 jpearson users 56965 Nov 3 11:09 statArchive-03-00.gfs 
-rw-rw-r-- 1 jpearson users 11308 Nov 3 11:27 system-01-00.log 
<b>-rw-rw-r-- 1 jpearson users 59650 Nov 3 11:34 statArchive-04-00.gfs 
-rw-rw-r-- 1 jpearson users 18178 Nov 3 11:34 system-04-00.log 
-rw-rw-r-- 1 jpearson users 55774 Nov 4 10:08 statArchive.gfs 
-rw-rw-r-- 1 jpearson users 17681 Nov 4 10:08 system.log</b></codeblock>The
				statistics and the log file are renamed using the next integer that is available to
				both, so the log file sequence jumps past the gap in this case. </p>

			<title>Log Level</title>
			<p>The higher the log level, the more important and urgent the message. If you are
				having problems with your system, a first-level approach is to lower the log-level
				(thus sending more of the detailed messages to the log file) and recreate the
				problem. The additional log messages often help uncover the source. </p>
