	<title>Altering When Buffers Are Flushed to Disk</title>
	<shortdesc> You can configure <keyword keyref="product_name"/> to write immediately to disk and
		you may be able to modify your operating system behavior to perform buffer flushes more
		frequently. </shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p>Typically, <keyword keyref="product_name"/> writes disk data into the operating system's disk
			buffers and the operating system periodically flushes the buffers to disk. Increasing
			the frequency of writes to disk decreases the likelihood of data loss from application
			or machine crashes, but it impacts performance. Your other option, which may give you
			better performance, is to use <keyword keyref="product_name"/>'s in-memory data backups.
			Do this by storing your data in multiple replicated regions or in partitioned regions
			that are configured with redundant copies. See <xref
				href="../../developing/region_options/region_types.xml#region_types" type="concept"
				format="dita" scope="local"/>. </p>

			<title>Modifying Disk Flushes for the Operating System</title>
			<p>You may be able to change the operating system settings for periodic flushes. You may
				also be able to perform explicit disk flushes from your application code. For
				information on these options, see your operating system's documentation. For
				example, in Linux you can change the disk flush interval by modifying the setting
					<codeph>/proc/sys/vm/dirty_expire_centiseconds</codeph>. It defaults to 30
				seconds. To alter this setting, see the Linux documentation for
					<codeph>dirty_expire_centiseconds</codeph>. </p>

			<title>Modifying <keyword keyref="product_name"/> to Flush Buffers on Disk
				Writes</title>
			<p> You can have <keyword keyref="product_name"/> flush the disk buffers on every disk
				write. Do this by setting the system property <codeph>gemfire.syncWrites</codeph> to
				true at the command line when you start your <keyword keyref="product_name"/> member. You can only modify
				this setting when you start a member. When this is set, <keyword
					keyref="product_name"/> uses a Java <codeph>RandomAccessFile</codeph> with the
				flags "rwd", which causes every file update to be written synchronously to the
				storage device. This only guarantees your data if your disk stores are on a local
				device. See the Java documentation for <codeph>java.IO.RandomAccessFile</codeph>. </p>
			<p>To modify the setting for a <keyword keyref="product_name"/> application, add this to
				the java command line when you start the member: </p>
				<codeblock>-Dgemfire.syncWrites=true</codeblock>
			<p>To modify the setting for a cache server, use this syntax: </p>
				<codeblock>gfsh&gt;start server --name=... --J=-Dgemfire.syncWrites=true</codeblock>
