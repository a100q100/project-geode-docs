	<title>Disk Store Operation Logs</title>
	<shortdesc>At creation, each operation log is initialized at the disk store's
			<codeph>max-oplog-size</codeph>, with the size divided between the <codeph>crf</codeph>
		and <codeph>drf</codeph> files. When the oplog is closed, <keyword
			keyref="product_name_long"/> shrinks the files to the space used in each file. </shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<section id="section_C0B1391492394A908577C29772902A42">
			<p>After the oplog is closed, <keyword keyref="product_name"/> also attempts to create a
					<codeph>krf</codeph> file, which contains the key names as well as the offset
				for the value within the <codeph>crf</codeph> file. Although this file is not
				required for startup, if it is available, it will improve startup performance by
				allowing <keyword keyref="product_name"/> to load the entry values in the background
				after the entry keys are loaded. </p>
			<p>When an operation log is full, <keyword keyref="product_name"/> automatically closes
				it and creates a new log with the next sequence number. This is called <i>oplog
					rolling</i>. You can also request an oplog rolling through the API call
					<codeph>DiskStore.forceRoll</codeph>. You may want to do this immediately before
				compacting your disk stores, so the latest oplog is available for compaction.</p>
			<note>
				<p>Log compaction can change the names of the disk store files. File number
					sequencing is usually altered, with some existing logs removed or replaced by
					newer logs with higher numbering. <keyword keyref="product_name"/> always starts
					a new log at a number higher than any existing number. 
				</p>
			</note>
			<p>This example listing shows the logs in a system with only one disk directory
				specified for the store. The first log (<codeph>BACKUPCacheOverflow_1.crf</codeph>
				and <codeph>BACKUPCacheOverflow_1.drf</codeph>) has been closed and the system is
				writing to the second log. </p>

			<p>The system rotates through all available disk directories to write its logs. The next
