	<title>How SSL Works</title>
	<shortdesc>For in transit data, SSL ensures that only the applications identified by you can
		share distributed system data. </shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p>To be secure, the data that is cached in a <keyword keyref="product_name"/> system must
			be protected during storage, distribution, and processing. At any time, data in a
			distributed system may be in one or more of these locations: </p>
			<ul
				id="ul_ECC1863FD2E24982AAF3E1BBDFBF5BA1">
				<li id="li_07A14ED64C9A4A7C93C98D2E2BDD92F7">In memory </li>
				<li id="li_44DB6CF3B6C24649A03C3B94A74DE345">On disk </li>
				<li id="li_CAF40294F491493D8E5AA90E5FD13E98">In transit between processes (for
					example, in an internet or intranet) </li>
			</ul>
		<p>For the protection of data in memory or on disk, <keyword keyref="product_name"/> relies
			on your standard system security features such as firewalls, operating system settings,
			and JDK security settings. </p>
		<p>The SSL implementation ensures that only the applications identified by you can share
			distributed system data in transit. In this figure, the data in the visible portion of
			the distributed system is secured by the firewall and by security settings in the
			operating system and in the JDK. The data in the disk files, for example, is protected
			by the firewall and by file permissions. Using SSL for data distribution provides secure
			communication between <keyword keyref="product_name"/> system members inside and outside
			the firewalls. </p>
