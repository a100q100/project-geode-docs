    <title>Multi-Site (WAN) Deployment Security</title>

    <conbody>
        <p>The following list covres guidelines for implementing security in multi-site (WAN)
                deployments:<ul id="ul_grw_hnb_rr">
                <li>Implement membership authentication. Depending on your installation and security
                    requirements, you may use a combination of peer-to-peer, client/server, and
                    multi-site settings. </li>
                <li>Joining members provide credentials to existing members who check the
                    credentials and either reject the joining member or approve it. In terms of
                    multi-site authentication, gateway senders and gateway receivers mutually
                    authenticate each other when they connect.</li>
                <li>If you want to use secure socket layer (SSL) protocol for your peer-to-peer and
                    client/server connections, implement that. You can configure SSL separately for
                    peer-to-peer, client/server, JMX, and WAN gateway connections.</li>
            </ul></p>
        <section>
            <title>Gateway SSL Configuration</title>
            <p> The following table lists the SSL configuration property names used to configure SSL
                for peer-to-peer and WAN gateway connections. Remember that if you do not define a
                client/server, JMX, or WAN property, then GemFire uses the property value defined
                for peer-to-peer communication (cluster-ssl*) or the default peer-to-peer property
                value if unspecified. </p>
