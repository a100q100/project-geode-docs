	<title>Recovering from Machine Crashes</title>
	<shortdesc>When a machine crashes because of a shutdown, power loss, hardware failure, or
		operating system failure, all of its applications and cache servers and their local caches
		are lost. </shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p>System members on other machines are notified that this machine’s members have left the
			distributed system unexpectedly. </p>

			<p>To recover from a machine crash: </p>

							<p>At least one locator must be

			<p>If you have to move a locator process to a different machine, the locator isn’t
				useful until you update the locators list in the <codeph>gemfire.properties</codeph>
				file and restart all the applications and cache servers in the distributed system.
				If other locators are running, however, you don’t have to restart the system
				immediately. For a list of the locators in use, check the locators property in one
				of the application <codeph>gemfire.properties</codeph> files. </p>

			<title>Data Recovery for Partitioned Regions</title>
			<p>The partitioned region initializes itself correctly regardless of the order in which
				the data stores rejoin. The applications and cache servers recreate their data
				automatically as they return to active work. </p>
			<p>If the partitioned region is configured for data redundancy, <keyword
					keyref="product_name"/> may be able to handle a machine crash automatically with
				no data loss, depending on how many redundant copies there are and how many members
				have to be restarted. See also <xref
					href="recovering_from_p2p_crashes.xml#rec_app_p2p_crash/section_0E7D482DD8E84250A10070431B29AAC5"
					type="section" format="dita" scope="local"
					><?xm-replace_text Recovery for Partitioned Regions?></xref>. </p>
			<p>If the partitioned region does not have redundant copies, the system members recreate
				the data through normal operation. If the member that crashed was an application,
				check whether it was designed to write its data to an external data source. If so,
				decide whether data recovery is possible and preferable to starting with new data
				generated through the <keyword keyref="product_name"/> distributed system. </p>

			<title>Data Recovery for Distributed Regions</title>
			<p>The applications and cache servers recreate their data automatically. Recovery
				happens through replicas, disk store files, or newly generated data, as explained in
					<xref
					href="recovering_from_p2p_crashes.xml#rec_app_p2p_crash/section_19CFA40F5EE64C4F8062BFBF7A6C1571"

					><?xm-replace_text Recovery for Distributed Regions?></xref>. </p>
			<p>If the recovery is from disk stores, you may not get all of the latest data.
				Persistence depends on the operating system to write data to the disk, so when the
				machine or operating system fails unexpectedly, the last changes can be lost. </p>
			<p>For maximum data protection, you can set up duplicate replicate regions on the
				network, with each one configured to back up its data to disk. Assuming the proper
				restart sequence, this architecture significantly increases your chances of
				recovering every update. </p>

			<title>Data Recovery in a Client/Server Configuration</title>
			<p>If the machine that crashed hosted a server, how the server recovers its data depends
				on whether the regions are partitioned or distributed. See <xref
					href="recovering_from_machine_crashes.xml#rec_system_crash/section_3D2B55C456024BBBBF2898EA4DDAFF5C"
					type="section" format="dita" scope="local"

					type="section" format="dita" scope="local"
					><?xm-replace_text Data Recovery for Distributed Regions?></xref> as
				appropriate. </p>
			<p>The impact of a server crash on its clients depends on whether the installation is
				configured for highly available servers. For information, see <xref
					href="recovering_from_cs_crashes.xml#rec_app_cs_crash" type="concept"
					format="dita" scope="local"
					><?xm-replace_text Recovering from Crashes with a Client/Server Configuration?></xref>. </p>
			<p>If the machine that crashed hosted a client, restart the client as quickly as
				possible and let it recover its data automatically from the server. For details, see
