  <title>Preventing and Recovering from Disk Full Errors</title>
  <shortdesc>It is important to monitor the disk usage of <keyword keyref="product_name"/> members.
    If a member lacks sufficient disk space for a disk store, the member attempts to shut down the
    disk store and its associated cache, and logs an error message. A shutdown due to a member
    running out of disk space can cause loss of data, data file corruption, log file corruption and
    other error conditions that can negatively impact your applications. </shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>After you make sufficient disk space available to the member, you can restart the member. </p>
    <p>You can prevent disk file errors using the following techniques: </p>
    <ul id="ul_ctx_2fm_jp">
      <li>If you are using ext4 file system, we recommend that you pre-allocate disk store files and
        disk store metadata files. Pre-allocation reserves disk space for these files and leaves the
        member in a healthy state when the disk store and regions are shut down, allowing you to
        restart the member once sufficient disk space has been made available. Pre-allocation is
        enabled by default. </li>
      <li>Configure critical usage thresholds
          (<systemoutput>disk-usage-warning-percentage</systemoutput> and
          <systemoutput>disk-usage-critical-percentage</systemoutput>) for the disk. By default,
        these are set to 90% for warning and 99% for errors that will shut down the cache.</li>
      <li>Follow the recommendations in <xref
          href="../disk_storage/optimize_availability_and_performance.xml#optimize_avail_disk_store"
        /> for general disk management best practices.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When a disk write fails due to disk full conditions, the member is shutdown and removed from
      the distributed system.</p>

      <title>Recovering from Disk Full Errors</title>
      <p>If a member of your <keyword keyref="product_name"/> distributed system fails due to a disk
        full error condition, add or make additional disk capacity available and attempt to restart
        the member normally. If the member does not restart and there is a redundant copy of its
        regions in a disk store on another member, you can restore the member using the following
        steps:</p>
      <ol id="ol_d4f_qhm_jp">
        <li>Delete or move the disk store files from the failed member.</li>
        <li>Use the gfsh <codeph>show missing-disk-stores</codeph> command to identify any missing
          data. You may need to manually restore this data.</li>
        <li>Revoke the missing disk stores using the <xref
            href="../../tools_modules/gfsh/command-pages/revoke.xml"
          /> gfsh command. </li>
        <li>Restart the member.</li>
      </ol>
