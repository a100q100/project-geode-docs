	<title>Choosing Between IPv4 and IPv6</title>
	<shortdesc id="shortdesc_A8FC3BEC1E9F443480AB1C359C283B4B">By default, <keyword
			keyref="product_name_long"/> uses Internet Protocol version 4 for <keyword
			keyref="product_name"/> address specifications. You can switch to Internet Protocol
		version 6 if all your machines support it. You may lose performance, so you need to
		understand the costs of making the switch. </shortdesc>

				<li id="li_8ACE2D76603E48218071189A91EEE5CA">IPv4 uses a 32-bit address. IPv4 was
					the first protocol and is still the main one in use, but its address space is
					expected to be exhausted within a few years. </li>
				<li id="li_9D2B1BEEEA7C4C7DA9D7CC90DCD54E01">IPv6 uses a 128-bit address. IPv6
					succeeds IPv4, and will provide a much greater number of addresses. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Based on current testing with <keyword keyref="product_name"/> , IPv4 is generally
				recommended. IPv6 connections tend to take longer to form and the communication
				tends to be slower. Not all machines support IPv6 addressing. To use IPv6, all
				machines in your distributed system must support it or you will have connectivity
				problems. <note>Do not mix IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Use one or the other, across the
					board. </note>IPv4 is the default version. </p>
			<p>To use IPv6, set the Java property, <codeph>java.net.preferIPv6Addresses</codeph>, to
					<codeph>true</codeph>. </p>
			<p>These examples show the formats to use to specify addresses in <keyword keyref="product_name"
