	<title>Standard Client/Server Deployment</title>
	<shortdesc>In the most common client/server topology, a farm of cache servers provides caching
		services to many clients. Cache servers have a homogeneous data store in data regions that
		are replicated or partitioned across the server farm. </shortdesc>

			<p>The client/server data flow proceeds as follows: </p>
				<ul

					<li id="li_DF648580E50948D4AEA90CD724B20EB7">Cache servers send their address
						and load information to the server locator, if locators are used. </li>
					<li id="li_740C7E178DC645A8AB3361268B0A75D3">If locators are used, clients
						request server connection information from the locator. The locator responds
						with the address of the least-loaded server. </li>
					<li id="li_9C6AB20603BD438A8768F56AD756D384">The client pool checks its
						connections periodically for proper server load balancing. The pool
						rebalances as needed. </li>
					<li id="li_B84A4A326AA349AEA3C36923D5AAB9D6">Clients can subscribe to events at
						startup. Events are streamed automatically from the servers to client
						listeners and into the client cache. </li>
					<li id="li_45E8FCDEC69C4C53A1F06ECF754613E3">Client data updates and data
						requests that the client cache does not fulfill are forwarded automatically
						to the servers. </li>
