  <title>Configuring and Running a Cluster</title>
  <shortdesc> You use the <codeph>gfsh</codeph> command-line utility to configure your <keyword
      keyref="product_name_long"/> cluster (also called a "distributed system"). The cluster
    configuration service persists the cluster configurations and distributes the configurations to
    members of the cluster. There are also several additional ways to configure a cluster. </shortdesc>
  <conbody>
    <p>You use <codeph>gfsh</codeph> to configure regions, disk stores, members, and other <keyword
        keyref="product_name"/> objects. You also use gfsh to start and stop locators, servers, and
        <keyword keyref="product_name"/> monitoring tools. As you execute these commands, the
      cluster configuration service persists the configuration. When new members join the cluster,
      the service distributes the configuration to the new members. </p>
    <p><codeph>gfsh</codeph> is the recommended means of configuring and managing your <keyword
        keyref="product_name_long"/> cluster, however you can still configure many aspects of a
      cluster using the older methods of the cache.xml and gemfire.properties files. See <xref
        href="../reference/topics/chapter_overview_cache_xml.xml"/> and the <xref
        href="../reference/book_intro.xml"/> for configuration parameters. You can also
      configure some aspects of a cluster using a Java API. See <xref
        href="../managing/book_intro.xml"/>.</p>
