	<title>Deploying Configuration Files without the Cluster Configuration Service</title>
	<shortdesc id="shortdesc_37F07FEFBB174F52890D56BEC8792FE1">You can deploy your <keyword
			keyref="product_name_long"/> configuration files in your system directory structure or
		in jar files. You determine how you want to deploy your configuration files and set them up
		accordingly. </shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<note>
			<p>If you use the cluster configuration service to create and manage your <keyword
				keyref="product_name_long"/> cluster configuration, the procedures described in this
			section are not needed because <keyword keyref="product_name"/> automatically manages
			the distribution of the configuration files and jar files to members of the cluster. See
				<xref href="../cluster_config/gfsh_persist.xml"/>.
			</p>
			<p>You can use
				the procedures described in this section to distribute configurations that are
				member-specific, or for situations where you do not want to use the cluster
				configuration service.
