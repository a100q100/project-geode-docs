  <title>Importing and Exporting Cache Snapshots</title> 
  <shortdesc><?xm-replace_text Short Description?>
  </shortdesc> 
  <conbody>
	 <p>The snapshot export/import feature allows a user (or more specifically
		an admin) to save the data in a region and later on to load that data into a
		region. The snapshot may be taken on one distributed system and loaded into
		another distributed system. A typical usage would be to capture data from a
		production system and move it into a smaller QA or development system. Another
		usage would be to capture the state of a system at known points in time that
		can be easily reloaded.
	 </p>
	 <p>The snapshot file contains all of the data from a particular region. The
		snapshot is a binary file that can be directly imported into a region or read
		entry-by-entry for further processing or transformation into other formats.
