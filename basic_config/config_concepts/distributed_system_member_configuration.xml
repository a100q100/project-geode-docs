			<title>Distributed System Membership and System Topologies</title>
			<p>Every <keyword keyref="product_name"/> process is a member of a distributed system,
				even if the distributed system is defined as standalone, with just one member. You
				can run an individual distributed system in isolation or you can combine systems for
				vertical and horizontal scaling. See <xref
					href="../../topologies_and_comm/topology_concepts/chapter_overview.xml"/>. <ul
					id="ul_D86A9A00CCBA4217BFF3E60948BC0A8B">
					<li id="li_D26747B1FB3947279105414165979447"><b>Peer-to-Peer Distributed
							Systems</b>. Members that define the same member discovery properties
						belong to the same distributed system and are peers to one another. </li>
					<li id="li_58030CD703274E5AB4D1FA032D8F4042"><b>Client/Server Installations</b>.
						The client/server topology uses relationships that you configure between
						members of multiple distributed systems. You configure some or all of the
						peers in one distributed system to act as cache servers to clients
						connecting from outside the system. Each server can host many client
						processes, managing cache access for all in an efficient, vertically
						hierarchical cache configuration. You configure the client applications to
						connect to the servers, using a client cache configuration. Clients run as
						members of standalone <keyword keyref="product_name"/> distributed systems,
						with no peers, so all data updates and requests go to the servers. </li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<title><b>Multi-site Installations</b></title>
			<p>The multi-site topology uses relationships that you configure between members of
				multiple distributed systems. Through this configuration, you loosely couple two or
				more distributed systems for automated data distribution. This is usually done for
				sites at geographically separate locations. You configure a subset of peers in each
				distributed system site with gateway senders and/or gateway receivers to manage
				events that are distributed between the sites. </p>
			<p>In the context of a single distributed system, unless otherwise specified, remote
				members refers to other members of the same distributed system. In client/server and
				multi-site installations, remote generally refers to members in other distributed
				systems. For example, all servers are remote to the clients that connect to them.
				Each client runs standalone, with connections only to the server tier, so all
				servers and their other clients are remote to the individual client. All gateway
				receivers are remote to the gateway senders that connect to them from other
				distributed systems,and to those gateway sendersâ€™ peers. </p>
