  <title>Data Location for Cache Transactions</title>
  <shortdesc>The location where you can run your transaction depends on where you are storing your
    data. </shortdesc>
  <conbody>
    <p>Transactions must operate on a data set that is hosted entirely by one member.</p>
      <ul
        id="ul_ws2_bc1_wk">
        <li>For replicated or other distributed regions, the transaction uses only the data set in
          the member where the transaction is run.</li>
        <li>For partitioned regions, you must colocate all your transactional data in a single
          member. See <xref href="../partitioned_regions/colocating_partitioned_region_data.xml"
          />.</li>
        <li>For transactions run on partitioned and distributed region mixes, you must colocate the
          partitioned region data and make sure the distributed region data is available in any
          member hosting the partitioned region data.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>For transactions involving partitioned regions, any member with the regions defined can
      orchestrate the transactional operations, regardless of whether that member hosts data for the
      regions. If the transactional data resides on a remote member, the transaction is carried out
      by proxy in the member hosting the data. The member hosting the data is referred to as the
      transaction host.</p>
