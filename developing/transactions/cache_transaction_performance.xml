  <title>Cache Transaction Performance</title>
  <shortdesc>Cache transaction performance can vary depending on the type of regions you are
    using.</shortdesc>
  <conbody>
    <p>The most common region configurations for use with transactions are distributed replicated
      and partitioned:</p>
      <ul id="ul_efh_qlt_vk">
        <li>Replicated regions are better suited for running transactions on small to mid-size data
          sets. To ensure all or nothing behavior, at commit time, distributed transactions use the
          global reservation system of the <keyword keyref="product_name"/> distributed lock
          service. This works well as long as the data set is reasonably small.</li>
        <li>Partitioned regions are the right choice for highly-performant, scalable operations.
          Transactions on partitioned regions use only local locking, and only send messages to the
          redundant data stores at commit time. Because of this, these transactions perform much
          better than distributed transactions. There are no global locks, so partitioned
          transactions are extremely scalable as well.</li>
      </ul>
