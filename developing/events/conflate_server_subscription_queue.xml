	<title>Conflate the Server Subscription Queue</title>
	<conbody>
		<section id="section_1791DFB89502480EB57F81D16AC0EBAC">
			<p>Conflating the server subscription queue can save space in the server and time in
				message processing. </p>
			<p>Enable conflation at the server level in the server region configuration:</p>
				<codeblock>&lt;region ... &gt;
  &lt;region-attributes enable-subscription-conflation="true" /&gt; 
&lt;/region&gt;</codeblock>
			<p>Override the server setting as needed, on a per-client basis, in the client’s
				<codeph>gemfire.properties</codeph>:</p>
				<codeblock>conflate-events=false</codeblock>Valid <codeph>conflate-events</codeph>
				settings are:
				<ul id="ul_AC1A01FB6F5743CDA7A08789190AF93A">
					<li id="li_79825CAD6D1E4A2D9857174B098CDDC5"><codeph>server</codeph>, which uses
						the server settings </li>
					<li id="li_8D68A7E085614569A2CD9823C6AFC83F"><codeph>true</codeph>, which
						conflates everything sent to the client </li>
					<li id="li_6F6B1DED4C0246B484A1B04C58D01819"><codeph>false</codeph>, which does
						not conflate anything sent to this client </li>
				</ul>
			<p>Conflation can both improve performance and reduce the amount of memory required on
				the server for queuing. The client receives only the latest available update in the
				queue for a particular entry key. Conflation is disabled by default. </p>
			<p>Conflation is particularly useful when a single entry is updated often and the
				intermediate updates don’t require processing by the client. With conflation, if an
				entry is updated and there is already an update in the queue for its key, the
				existing update is removed and the new update is placed at the end of the queue.
				Conflation is only done on messages that are not in the process of being sent to the
				client. </p>

			<note>
				<p>This method of conflation is different from the one used for multi-site gateway sender
				queue conflation. It is the same as the method used for the conflation of
				peer-to-peer distribution messages within a single distributed system.
