		<title>Monitoring Queries for Low Memory</title>
		<shortdesc> The query monitoring feature prevents out-of-memory exceptions from occurring
			when you execute queries or create indexes. </shortdesc>
		<body>
			<p>This feature is automatically enabled when you set a
					<codeph>critical-heap-percentage</codeph> attribute for the resource-manager
				element in cache.xml or by using the
					<codeph>cache.getResourceManager().setCriticalHelpPercentage(float
					heapPercentage)</codeph> API. Use this feature to cancel out queries that are
				taking too long and to warn the user that there are low memory conditions when they
				are running queries or creating indexes. </p>
			<p>You can override this feature by setting the system property
					<codeph>gemfire.cache.DISABLE_QUERY_MONITOR_FOR_LOW_MEMORY</codeph> to true. </p>
			<p>When the query memory monitoring feature is on, the default query time out is set to
				five hours. You can override this value by setting a larger or smaller, non -1 value
				to the existing query time out system variable
					<codeph>gemfire.cache.MAX_QUERY_EXECUTION_TIME</codeph>. </p>
			<p>When system memory is low (as determined by the critical heap percentage threshold
				that you defined in cache.xml or in the getResourceManager API ), queries will throw
				a <codeph>QueryExecutionLowMemoryException</codeph>. Any indexes that are in the
				process of being created will throw an <codeph>InvalidIndexException</codeph> with
				the message indicating the reason. </p>

				<title>Partitioned Region Queries and Low Memory</title>
				<p>Partitioned region queries are likely causes for out-of-memory exceptions. If
					query monitoring is enabled, partitioned region queries drop or ignore results
					that are being gathered by other servers if the executing server is low in
					memory. </p>
				<p>Query-monitoring does not address a scenario in which a low-level collection is
					expanded while the partitioned region query is gathering results. For example,
					if a row is added and then causes a Java level collection or array to expand, it
					is possible to then encounter an out-of-memory exception. This scenario is rare
					and is only possible if the collection size itself expands before a low memory
					condition is met and then expands beyond the remaining available memory. As a
					workaround, in the event that you encounter this situation, you may be able to
					tune the system by additionally lowering the
						<codeph>critical-heap-percentage</codeph>. </p>
