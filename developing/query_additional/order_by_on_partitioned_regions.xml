	<title>Using ORDER BY on Partitioned Regions</title>
	<shortdesc><?xm-replace_text Short Description?>
	</shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p> To execute a query with an ORDER BY clause on a partitioned region, the fields specified
			in the ORDER BY clause must be part of the projection list. </p>
		<p>When an ORDER BY clause is used with a partition region query, the query is executed
			separately on each region host, the local query coordinator, and all remote members. The
			results are all gathered by the query coordinator. The cumulative result set is built by
			applying ORDER BY on the gathered results. If the LIMIT clause is also used in the
			query, ORDER BY and LIMIT are applied on each node before each nodeâ€™s results are
			returned to the coordinator. Then the clauses are applied to the cumulative result set
			to get the final result set, which is returned to the calling application. </p>
		<p>
			<b>Example:</b>
			<codeblock>// This query works because p.status is part of projection list
select distinct p.ID, p.status from /region p where p.ID &gt; 5 order by p.status
// This query works providing status is part of the value indicated by *
select distinct * from /region where ID &gt; 5 order by status </codeblock>
		</p>
