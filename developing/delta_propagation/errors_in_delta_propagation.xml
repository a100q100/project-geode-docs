			<p>Errors in delta propagation fall into two categories based on how they are handled by
				the system: </p>
				<ul id="ul_5155B1672CF54D779E622C93995619BA">
					<li id="li_8466CFE0B06243C78AB910503CDF06AF">Problems applying the delta that
						can be remedied by requesting the full value in place of the delta. Your
							<codeph>put</codeph> operation does not see errors or exceptions related
						to this type of delta propagation failure. The system automatically does a
						full value distribution from the sender to the receiver where the problem
						occurs. This type of error includes: <ul
							id="ul_EEE6F8E2B3CD4B7CA629F1ECEAF41934">
							<li id="li_6AB18114BAC34A4AA0C50B78DB2EBA1F">Unavailable entry value in
								the receiving cache, either because the entry is missing or its
								value is null. In both cases, there is nothing to apply the delta to
								and the full value must be sent. This is most likely to occur if you
								destroy or invalidate your entries locally, either through
								application calls or through configured actions like eviction or
								entry expiration. </li>
							<li id="li_E18911E899254A02A6747F3D1644F9AD"
									><codeph>InvalidDeltaException</codeph> thrown by
									<codeph>fromDelta</codeph> method, programmed by you. This
								exception enables you to avoid applying deltas that would violate
								data consistency checks or other application requirements. </li>
							<li id="li_495E2AE4F02049FBAC2E55CCE48B632C">Any error applying the
								delta in a client in server-to-client propagation. The client logs a
								warning in addition to retrieving the full value from the server.

						the delta that cannot be fixed by distributing the full value. In these
						cases, your <codeph>put</codeph> operation fails with an exception. This
