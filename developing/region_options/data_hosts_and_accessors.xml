	<title>Region Data Stores and Data Accessors</title>

			<p>In most cases, when you define a data region in a memberâ€™s cache, you also specify
				whether the member is a data store. Members that store data for a region are
				referred to as data stores or data hosts. Members that do not store data are
				referred to as accessor members, or empty members. Any member, store or accessor,
				that defines a region can access it, put data into it, and receive events from other
				members. To configure a region so the member is a data accessor, you use
				configurations that specify no local data storage for the region. Otherwise, the
				member is a data store for the region. </p>
