	<title>Memory Requirements for Cached Data</title>
	<shortdesc> <keyword keyref="product_name"/> solutions architects need to estimate resource requirements for meeting
		application performance, scalability and availability goals. </shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p>These requirements include estimates for the following resources:</p>
			<ul
				id="ul_9A454A650F0A4F51BF5D4BF164D4EACB">
				<li id="li_9C5C762EB16B4079A0329F23250DF74B">memory</li>
				<li id="li_B6E5EE600B7D4592B500643007FAB9DE">number of machines </li>
				<li id="li_30D8C289B7DC4F839D5F05E9127E9444">network bandwidth </li>
			</ul>
		<p>The information here is only a guideline, and assumes a basic understanding of  <keyword keyref="product_name"/>.
			While no two applications or use cases are exactly alike, the information here should be
			a solid starting point, based on real-world experience. Much like with physical database
			design, ultimately the right configuration and physical topology for deployment is based
			on the performance requirements, application data access characteristics, and resource
			constraints (i.e., memory, CPU, and network bandwidth) of the operating environment.
