			<title>Running gfsh Scripts</title>
			<p>You can create and run scripts that contain gfsh commands that you wish to execute. To execute
				the script, use the gfsh <xref href="command-pages/run.xml" type="concept"
					format="dita" scope="local">run</xref> command. For example:  </p>
			<codeblock>gfsh run --file=mycommands.gfsh</codeblock>
			<note>When you run a gfsh script, interactive parameters are
				ignored. You can also set the script to run in quiet mode to
				prevent output and instruct the script to skip any errors it
				encounters. </note>
			<p>Your command history file can be helpful when you write a gfsh
				script. A history of commands that have been executed
				successfully is logged in the <codeph>.gfsh.history</codeph>
				file in the home directory of the user running gfsh. You can
				also export a history file with the <codeph>history
					--file=your_file_name</codeph> command. </p>
