	<title>Basic Shell Features and Command-Line Usage</title>
	<shortdesc>The <codeph>gfsh</codeph> utility provides useful features for a shell environment,
		including command auto-complete, preserved command history, and delimiting of multi-line
		commands. Context-sensitive help is available by command and by topic. </shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<section id="section_A7A871DBD8C7464A80CEB007798E5AE7">
			<p>This section describes these features. </p>
			<p><b>To view a list of available gfsh commands, press Tab at an empty prompt.</b>
			</p>
			<p>The list of commands you see depends on whether you are connected to a <keyword
					keyref="product_name"/> distributed system. If you are not connected, you see a
				list of local commands that are available.

			<p><b>Use the hint command to get information on a particular topic.</b>
			</p>
			<p>The hint command displays a one-line description and associated commands for a
				specified topic. For example, typing <b>hint data</b> returns a description of the
				"data" topic and all the possible actions available for data:
				<codeblock>gfsh&gt;hint data
User data as stored in regions of the GemFire distributed system.

create index  : Create an index that can be used when executing queries.
destroy index : Destroy/Remove the specified index.
export data   : Export user data from a region to a file.
get           : Display an entry in a region. If using a region whose key and value classes have been set, then specifying --key-class and --value-class is unnecessary.
import data   : Import user data from a file to a region.
list indexes  : Display the list of indexes created for all members.
locate entry  : Identifies the location, including host, member and region, of entries that have the specified key.
put           : Add/Update an entry in a region. If using a region whose key and value classes have been set, then specifying --key-class and --value-class is unnecessary.
query         : Run the specified OQL query as a single quoted string and display the results in one or more pages. Limit will default to the value stored in the "APP_FETCH_SIZE" variable. Page size will default to the value stored in the "APP_COLLECTION_LIMIT" variable.
rebalance     : Rebalance partitioned regions. The default is for all partitioned regions to be rebalanced.
remove        : Remove an entry from a region. If using a region whose key class has been set, then specifying --key-class is unnecessary.

			<p>Type <codeph>hint server</codeph> to view a description of servers in <keyword
					keyref="product_name"/> and a list of commands available for managing and
				monitoring them.
				<codeblock>gfsh&gt;hint server
A server is GemFire cluster member which holds a GemFire cache. Depending on the topology used it can refer to either a system that responds to client requests or a system that is only a peer to other members.

describe member : Display information about a member, including name, id, groups, regions, etc.
export logs     : Export the log files for a member or members.
list members    : Display all or a subset of members.
start server    : Start a GemFire Cache Server.
status server   : Display the status of a GemFire Cache Server.
stop server     : Stop a GemFire Cache Server.
</codeblock>

			<p><b>To view a list of hint topics, type <codeph>hint</codeph>.</b>
				<codeblock>gfsh&gt;hint
Hints are available for the following topics. Use "hint &lt;topic-name&gt;" for a specific hint.

			<p><b>Use the <b>help</b> command to get information on a particular command.</b>
			</p>
			<p>Depending on the command, typing <codeph>help <i>&lt;command-name&gt;</i></codeph>
				displays usage information for that particular command or a list of commands related
				to the command. </p>
			<p>For example, type <codeph>help start</codeph> to display a list of start commands
				with short descriptions. The descriptions indicate whether the command is available,
				depending on your connection status. In the following example, you are not currently
				connected to a <keyword keyref="product_name"/> distributed system (via connection
				to a JMX Manager node), so some start commands are unavailable.
				<codeblock>
gfsh&gt;help start
start gateway-receiver (Not Available)
    Start the Gateway Receiver on a member or members.
start gateway-sender (Not Available)
    Start the Gateway Sender on a member or members.

    VisualVM will be launched, but connecting to GemFire must be done manually.
start locator (Available)

start pulse (Available)
    Open a new window in the default Web browser with the URL for the Pulse
    application.
start server (Available)
    Start a GemFire Cache Server.

			<p>In the following example, typing <codeph>help export data</codeph> displays the
				command name, availability (depending on your connection status), a description, its
				syntax, and a list of all its required and optional parameters.
				<codeblock>gfsh&gt;help export data

			<p id="p_sb2_ttx_n4"><b>Use the Tab key to auto-complete a command or trigger possible

			</p>Use the Tab key after entering a partial command to trigger auto-completion of the
			command or a list of possible command completions. For example, hitting Tab after typing
				<codeph>hint</codeph> displays all available topics:

			Hitting tab after typing <codeph>hint d</codeph> displays the topics available that
			begin with 'd':
			<codeblock>gfsh&gt;hint d

data            debug-Utility   disk Store</codeblock>Auto-completion
			also supplies available parameters and arguments to commands; for example, hitting tab
			after typing <codeph>start</codeph> will list all the processes that can be started. <codeblock>gfsh&gt;start

start data-browser   start jconsole       start jvisualvm
start locator        start pulse          start server</codeblock>
			<p>Hitting tab after <codeph>start locator</codeph> will populate the required
					<codeph>--name</codeph> parameter after the command. <note>The available
					commands that are listed varies depending on whether you are currently connected
					to a distributed system. </note>
			</p><p>To use auto-completion from a UNIX bash shell, see <xref
					href="configuring_gfsh.xml#concept_3B9C6CE2F64841E98C33D9F6441DF487/section_jcs_ltx_n4"
				/>.</p>
			<p><b> Access command history with the Up arrow.</b>
			</p>
			<p> Access a command in your shell history by scrolling through previous commands with
				the Up arrow. </p>
			<p><b>Delimit multi-line commands with \.</b>
			</p>
			<p>When entering long commands, you can break the command line up by using the \
				character as a delimiter. For example:
				<codeblock>gfsh&gt;create region --name=region1 \
--type=REPLICATE_PERSISTENT \
--cache-writer=com.gemstone.gemfire.examples.MyCacheWriter \
--group=Group1 --disk-store=DiskStore1</codeblock>
			</p><p><b>Enclose strings that contain spaces or commas with single or double
				quotes</b></p><p>When you execute gfsh commands in the gfsh command shell, enclose
				any strings that contain spaces or commas in single quotes. For
				example:<codeblock>gfsh>start locator --name=<b>'locator 1'</b></codeblock><codeblock>start locator --name=locator1 --port=9009 --mcast-port=0\
 --J=<b>'-Dgemfire.remote-locators=10.117.33.214[9009],10.117.33.220[9009]'</b></codeblock></p><p>When
				you execute multiple gfsh commands in a single line from the operating system shell,
				enclose the gfsh commands in double quotes. Within the double quotes, enclose any
				strings that contain spaces or commas with single quotes. For
				example:<codeblock>$ gfsh -e <b>"</b>start locator --name=<b>'</b>locator 1<b>'"</b> -e <b>"</b>start server --name=server1<b>"</b></codeblock></p>
