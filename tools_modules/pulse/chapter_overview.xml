	<title><keyword keyref="product_name"/> Pulse</title>
	<shortdesc><keyword keyref="product_name"/> Pulse is a Web Application that provides a graphical
		dashboard for monitoring vital, real-time health and performance of <keyword
			keyref="product_name"/> clusters, members, and regions. </shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p>Use Pulse to examine total memory, CPU, and disk space used by members, uptime statistics,
			client connections, WAN connections, and critical notifications. Pulse communicates with
			a <keyword keyref="product_name"/> JMX manager to provide a complete view of your
				<keyword keyref="product_name"/> deployment. You can drill down from a high-level
			cluster view to examine individual members and even regions within a member, to filter
			the type of information and level of detail. </p>
		<p>By default, <keyword keyref="product_name"/> Pulse runs in an embedded container within a
				<keyword keyref="product_name"/> JMX manager node. You can optionally deploy Pulse
			to a Web application server of your choice, so that the tool runs independently of your
				<keyword keyref="product_name"/> clusters. Hosting Pulse on an application server
			also enables you to use SSL for accessing the application. </p>
