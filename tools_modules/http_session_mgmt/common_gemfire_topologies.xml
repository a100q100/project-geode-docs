			<p>In a peer-to-peer configuration, each instance within an application server contains its own
				cache. Each instance communicates with the locator and with other instances as
				peers. By default, data is replicated. A peer-to-peer configuration is useful when
				multiple systems want fast access to all session data. This configuration is also
				the simplest one to set up and does not require any external processes. </p>

			<title>Client/Server Configuration</title>
			<p><image id="image_oss_zyw_rv" href="../../images_svg/http_module_cs_with_locator.svg"/></p>
			<p>In a client/server configuration, the Tomcat or tc Server instance operates as a
					<keyword keyref="product_name"/> client, which must communicate with one or more
					<keyword keyref="product_name"/> servers to acquire session data. The client
				maintains its own local cache and will communicate with the server to satisfy cache
				misses. A client/server configuration is useful when you want to separate the
				application server instance from the cached session data. In this configuration, you
				can reduce the memory consumption of the application server since session data is
				stored in separate <keyword keyref="product_name"/> server processes. </p>
