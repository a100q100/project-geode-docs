  <title>HTTP Session Management Module for AppServers</title> 
  <shortdesc> You implement session caching with the HTTP Session Management
	 Module for AppServers with a special filter, defined in the 
	 <codeph>web.xml</codeph>, which is configured to intercept and wrap all
	 requests. 
  </shortdesc> 
  <conbody> 
	 <p>You can use this HTTP module with a variety of application servers. Wrapping each request
			allows the interception of <codeph>getSession()</codeph> calls to be handled by <keyword
				keyref="product_name"/> instead of the native container. This approach is a generic
			solution, which is supported by any container that implements the Servlet 2.4
			specification. </p>
