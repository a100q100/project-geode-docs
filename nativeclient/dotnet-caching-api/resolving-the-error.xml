	<title>Resolving the Error</title>
	<conbody>
		<p>Each computer where the common language runtime is installed has a machine-wide code
			cache called the Global Assembly Cache (GAC). The global assembly cache stores
			assemblies specifically designated to be shared by several applications on the computer. </p>
		<p>
			
As a general
			guideline, keep assembly dependencies private, and locate assemblies in the application
			directory unless sharing an assembly is explicitly required. Share assemblies by
			installing them into the global assembly cache only when necessary. </p>
