	<title>.NET Application Domains </title>
	<shortdesc>Application domains, or <codeph>AppDomain</codeph>s, are units of isolation, security
		boundaries, and loading and unloading for applications in the .NET runtime. Multiple
		application domains can run in a single process. Each can have one or many threads, and a
		thread can switch application domains at runtime. </shortdesc>
	<conbody>
			<note>
				<p>Before you use application domains with <keyword keyref="product_name"/>, make sure you
				understand how to use them generally in your .NET programming. </p>
			</note>
		<p>The .NET managed assemblies require interface methods invoked by the native C++ layer to
			be in the same <codeph>AppDomain</codeph> as that of the .NET DLL. If not, an exception
			is thrown because the thread is unable to cross <codeph>AppDomain</codeph> boundaries.
