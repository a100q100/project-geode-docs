	<title>Serialize with PDX Serialization</title>
	<shortdesc><keyword keyref="product_name"/>'s Portable Data eXchange (PDX) is a cross-language data
		format that can reduce the cost of distributing and serializing your objects. PDX stores
		data in named fields that you can access individually, to avoid the cost of deserializing
		the entire data object. PDX also allows you to mix versions of objects where you have added
		or removed fields. </shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p>PDX serialization is supported by C++ clients. If you have C++ clients that may receive events
			for a region, you can now use PDX serialization on the region's entries. </p>
		<p>You have two options for <keyword keyref="product_name"/> PDX serialization when using the C#
			.NET caching API. You can program your domain objects using the
				<codeph>IPdxSerializable</codeph> interface, or you can use <keyword
				keyref="product_name"/>â€™s reflection-based autoserializer. </p>
