	<title>Transactions</title>
	<shortdesc><i>Transactions</i> describes how transactions work on the client side. It provides
		examples for running, suspending, and resuming transactions. </shortdesc>
	<conbody>
			<note>
				<p><keyword keyref="product_name"/> client transactions run on the server tier. The client uses
				a server delegate that runs the transaction as it would a local transaction. Thus,
				the key to running client transactions lies in making sure the server is properly
				configured and programmed. For complete information about <keyword
					keyref="product_name"/> transactions in the Java server, see <xref
					href="../../developing/transactions/chapter_overview.xml" type="concept"
					format="dita" scope="local"><?xm-replace_text Transactions?></xref>. It provides
				detailed information including server data requirements, interactions of <keyword
					keyref="product_name"/> transactions with other operations running on the server
				tier, server-side application plug-ins with transactions, and querying with
				transactions. </p>
