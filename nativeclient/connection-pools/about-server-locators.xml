	<title>Server Locators</title>
	<shortdesc>Server locators continuously monitor server availability and server load information.
		The client is configured with a list of server locators and consults a server locator to
		request a connection to a server in the distributed system. </shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p>Locators provide clients with dynamic server discovery and server load balancing. They
			give clients connection information for the server with the least load at any given
			time. </p>
		<p>Server locators provide these main features: </p>
		<ul
			id="ul_8B9CA14A767C4CFC83BBDC3FAC016F19">
			<li
				id="li_718BBE82E4904F65AA41B9C7C031A245"><b>Automated discovery of servers and
					locators</b>. Adding and removing servers or locators is made easy as each
				client does not require a list of servers to be configured at the time of pool
				creation. </li>
			<li
				id="li_D08E0693067248FD95684434FC5433DE"><b>Client load rebalancing</b>. Server
				locators give clients dynamic server information and provide server load rebalancing
				after servers depart or join the system. </li>
			<li
				id="li_DED12F808E0A4F62960F437598D5D96B"><b>High availability</b>. When a
				client/server connection receives an exception, the connection is automatically
				failed over to another available connection in the pool. Redundancy is also provided
				for client subscriptions. </li>
		</ul>
		<p>Alternatively, you can configure a pool statically with a list of endpoints. When the
			pools are statically configured, a round-robin load balancing policy is used to
			distribute connections across the servers. </p>
