	<title>Configuring PDX to Ignore Unread Fields During Deserialization</title>

	<shortdesc>Use the <codeph>setPdxIgnoreUnreadFields</codeph> API to control whether PDX ignores
		fields that were unread during deserialization. </shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p>The default is to preserve unread fields by including their data during serialization.
			However, if you configure the cache to ignore unread fields then their data will be lost
			during serialization. </p>
		<p>You should only set this attribute to <codeph>true</codeph> if you know this member will only
			be reading cache data. In this use case you do not need to pay the cost of preserving
			unread fields since you will never reserialize the PDX data. </p>
		<p>For example:</p>
			<codeblock>CacheFactoryPtr cfPtr = CacheFactory::createCacheFactory(PropertiesObj);
cfPtr-&gt;setPdxReadSerialized(tue);
cfPtr-&gt;setPdxIgnoreUnreadFields(false);
cachePtr = cfPtr-&gt;create();
</codeblock>
