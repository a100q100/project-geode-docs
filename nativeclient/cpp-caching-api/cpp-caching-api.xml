	<title>Pivotal GemFire Native Client C++ API</title>
	<shortdesc> This sectiondescribes the primary classes, and usage conventions for the native client
		C++ API. It demonstrates how to use the API to create caches and perform data serialization. </shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p>The native client C++ API allows C++ and .NET developers to programmatically create, populate,
			and manage a <keyword keyref="product_name"/> distributed system. The C++ library is
			thread-safe, except where specified otherwise in the online API documentation. </p>
		<p>The online C++ API documentation is included in the <codeph>docs/cppdocs</codeph> directory of
			the native client product installation. It provides extensive implementation details for
			the C++ structures and functions. </p>
		<p>
			Several example API
			programs are included in the <codeph>SampleCode</codeph> directory. See <xref
