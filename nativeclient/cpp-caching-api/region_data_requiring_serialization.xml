			avoids changing the data format whenever possible. This means your data may be stored in
			the cache in serialized or deserialized form, depending on how you use it. For example,
			if a server acts only as a storage location for data distribution between clients, it
			makes sense to leave the data in serialized form, ready to be transmitted to clients
			that request it. Partitioned region data is always stored in serialized form with one
			exceptionâ€”functions that add data to a partitioned region locally use the deserialized
			form. </p>
