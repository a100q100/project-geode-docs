  <title>When to Use Serialization</title> 
  <shortdesc>Region data in many scenarios must be serializable. You can store
	 your data in the cache in serialized or deserialized form, depending on how you

	 <p>To minimize the cost of serialization and deserialization, GemFire
		avoids changing the data format whenever possible. This means you can store
		your data in the cache in serialized or deserialized form, depending on how you
		use it. For example, if a server acts only as a storage location for data
		distribution between clients, it makes sense to leave the data in serialized
		form, ready to be transmitted to clients that request it.
