	<title>Serializing Data with PDX Serialization</title>
	<shortdesc>PDX is a cross-language data format that can reduce the cost of distributing and
		serializing your objects. PDX stores data in named fields that you can access individually
		to avoid the cost of deserializing the entire data object. When you use PDX serialization
		with the native client C++ API, you can register a PdxSerializer for the entire cache,
		implement PDX serialization for each domain object or use automatic PDX serialization by
		running the <codeph>pdxautoserializer</codeph> tool. </shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p>You can also set the object preference of the cache to the PdxInstance type, which allows
			you to access fields of a PDX object without deserializing the entire object. </p>
		<p>When using the native client C++ API, you can opt to use PDX autoserialization. The <keyword
				keyref="product_name"/> native client provides a command line tool called
				<codeph>pdxautoserializer</codeph> that will automatically generate C++ code that
			will PDX serialize the class you want to serialize. </p>
	</conbody>
