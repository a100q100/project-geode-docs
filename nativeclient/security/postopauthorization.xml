	<shortdesc>Authorization in the post-operation phase occurs on the server after the operation is
		complete and before the results are sent to the client. </shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p>
			

The callback can modify the results of certain
			operations, such as <codeph>query</codeph>, <codeph>get</codeph> and
				<codeph>keySet</codeph>, or even completely disallow the operation. For example, a
			post-operation callback for a query operation can filter out sensitive data or data that
			the client should not receive, or even completely fail the operation. </p>
		<p>The <codeph>security-client-accessor-pp</codeph> system property in the serverâ€™s
				<codeph>gemfire.properties</codeph> file specifies the callback to invoke in the
			post-operation phase. For example: </p>
		<p>
			<codeph>security-client-accessor-pp=templates.security.XmlAuthorization.create</codeph>
