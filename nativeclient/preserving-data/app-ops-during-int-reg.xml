	<title>Application Operations During Interest Registration</title>
	<shortdesc>As soon as the client creates its regions, the application hosting the client can
		start cache operations, even while the client is still receiving its interest registration
		responses. </shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p>In that case, application operations take precedence over interest registration
			responses. </p>
		<p>When adding register interest responses to the cache, the following rules are applied: </p>
		<ul
			id="ul_68123A9320344971A6AE35D0B6E6188F">
			<li
				id="li_3A2B623D620049BE883F7F370DF76661">If the entry already exists in the cache
				with a valid value, it is not updated. </li>
			<li
				id="li_E8CDE6BC27A145AD8C52D2449FEDB8DE">If the entry is invalid and the register
				interest response is valid, the valid value is put into the cache. </li>
			<li
				id="li_EA46A779F1D74109B73FD2F5EF51484D">If an entry is marked destroyed, it is not
				updated. Destroyed entries are removed from the system after the register interest
				response is completed. </li>
		</ul>
		<p>If the interest response does not contain any results because all of those keys are
			absent from the server’s cache, the client’s cache can start out empty. If the queue
			contains old messages related to those keys, the events are still replayed in the
			client’s cache. </p>
