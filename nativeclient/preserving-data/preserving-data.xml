	<title>Preserving Data</title>
	<shortdesc> A server may preserve the data queued and intended to be sent to a native client, such
		that the data is not discarded if communication between the server and native client is
		disrupted. Preservation prevents message loss, which can cause a native client to have
		inconsistent data. Redundant queues and a high availability server implementation may
		further ensure that queued data is not lost.</shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p>There is a tradeoff between the quantity of data that a server must queue and the amount of
			time that the server  maintains and continues to queue data intended for a native client
			that is not communicating with the distributed system. Client configuration specifies
			the amount of time that the server is to continue queueing messages. High availability
			permits a secondary server to assume the role of a primary server with respect to queued
			data in the event that the primary server no longer functions. Designation of primary
			and secondary servers, as well as the number of redundant copies of the queue are
			configurable.</p>
