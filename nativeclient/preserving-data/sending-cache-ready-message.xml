	<title>Sending Cache Ready Messages to the Server</title>
	<shortdesc>After a durable client connects and initializes its cache, regions, cache listeners,
		and any interest registration, it invokes <codeph>readyForEvents</codeph> to indicate to the
		servers that the client is ready to receive any messages accumulated for it. </shortdesc>

			<title>Durable Client Cache Ready Notification (C++)</title>
			<p>
				

The following example shows how to call
				<codeph>readyForEvents</codeph>.</p>
				<codeblock>//Send ready for event message to server(only for durable clients).
//Server will send queued events to client after receiving this.
cachePtr-&gt;readyForEvents();</codeblock>
			<p>To keep the client from losing events, do not call this method until all regions and
				listeners are created. For more information, see <xref
