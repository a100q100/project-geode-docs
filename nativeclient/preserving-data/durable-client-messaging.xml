	<title>Durable Client Messaging</title>
	<shortdesc>You can configure the redundancy level for client queues that are stored on cache
		servers. This ensures that the client will not lose messages if it loses the connection to
		its primary server. </shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p>Durable messaging allows a disconnected client application to recover its subscribed data
			when it reconnects to the cache server because the server continues to queue messages
			for which the client has registered interest. </p>
