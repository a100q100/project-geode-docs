  <conbody> 
	 <p>Redundancy management is handled by the client, so when the client is
		disconnected from the server the redundancy of client events is not maintained.
		Even if the servers fail one at a time, so that running clients have time to
		fail over and pick new secondary servers, an offline durable client cannot fail
		over. As a result, the client loses its queued messages.
