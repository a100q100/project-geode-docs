  <title>Sending the Cache Ready Message to the Server</title> 
  <shortdesc>After a durable client connects and initializes its cache,
	 regions, cache listeners, and any interest registration, it needs to invoke 
	 <codeph>readyForEvents</codeph> to indicate to the servers that the client
	 is ready to receive any messages accumulated for it.
  </shortdesc>

		<title>Durable Client Cache Ready Notification (C++)</title>
		<p>The following example shows how to call 
		  <codeph>readyForEvents.</codeph>
		  <codeblock>//Send ready for event message to server(only for durable clients).
//Server will send queued events to client after receiving this.
cachePtr-&gt;readyForEvents();</codeblock>
		</p>
		<p>To keep the client from losing events, do not call this method until
		  all regions and listeners are created. For more information, see Reconnection
		  on page 158.
