  <title>Serialize Using GemFire Pdx Serialization</title> 
  <shortdesc>GemFire's Portable Data eXchange (PDX) is a cross-language data
	 format that can help reduce the cost of distributing and serializing your
	 objects. PDX stores data in named fields that you can access individually, to
	 avoid the cost of deserializing the entire data object. PDX also allows you to
	 mix versions of objects where you have added or removed fields.
  </shortdesc> 
  <conbody>
	 <note>PDX does not work with C++ clients. If you have C++ clients that may
		receive events for a region, you cannot use PDX serialization on the region's
		entries.
	 </note>
	 <p>You have two options for GemFire PDX serialization. You can program your
		domain objects using the 
		<codeph>IPdxSerializable</codeph> interface or you can use GemFireâ€™s
		reflection-based autoserializer.
