  <title>The .NET Caching API</title> 
  <shortdesc>The Microsoft .NET Framework interface for the vFabric GemFire
	 native client provides complete access to the native client C++ functionality
	 from any .NET Framework language (C#, C++/CLI, VB.NET, J#). This enables
	 clients using C# and other .NET languages to use the capabilities provided by
	 the GemFire C++ API.

	 </p>
	 <p>The GemFire native client uses a set of assemblies managed by the C++
		Common Language Infrastructure (C++/CLI). C++/CLI includes the libraries and
		objects necessary for common language types, and it is the framework for .NET
		applications.
	 </p>
	 <note>C# is used as the reference language in this chapter, but any other
		.NET language works the same.
	 </note>
	 <p>The API documentation in the native client product docs directory
		provides extensive implementation details for the C++ and .NET structures and
		functions. Example API programs are included in the productDir/examples
		directory.
