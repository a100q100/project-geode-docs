  <shortdesc> The vFabric GemFire native client can be configured for data loss
	 prevention in cases where either the cache server that the client is
	 communicating with loses its connection, or if the native client is temporarily

	 <p otherprops="pdf"> The vFabric GemFire native client can be configured
		for data loss prevention in cases where either the cache server that the client
		is communicating with loses its connection, or if the native client is
		temporarily disconnected or abnormally terminated from the distributed system.
	 </p>
	 <p>Data preservation is accomplished by ensuring that reliable event
		messaging is maintained between the client and the cache server. Any lost
		messages intended to be sent to a client as create , update or invalidate
		events for cached entries can quickly cause the data in the client cache to be
		unsynchronized and out of date with the rest of the distributed system.

		<xref></xref>This chapter describes the configuration and operation of
		native clients to prevent data loss in the event of client or server failure.
