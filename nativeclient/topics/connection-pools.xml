  <title>Using Connection Pools</title>

  <conbody>
    <p>The vFabric GemFire connection pool API supports connecting to servers
    through server locators or directly connecting to servers. In a
    distributed system, servers can be added or removed and their capacity to
    service new client connections may vary. The locators continuously monitor
    server availability and server load information and provide clients with
    the connection information of the server with the least load at any given
    time. Locators provide clients with dynamic server discovery and server
    load balancing. Clients are configured with locator information, and
    depend on the locators for server connectivity.</p>

    <p>Server locators provide these main features:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Automated Discovery of Servers and Locators—Adding and removing
      servers or locators is made easy as each client does not require a list
      of servers to be configured at the time of pool creation.</li>

      <li>Client Load Rebalancing—Spreading the client load over servers in a
      distributed system is made efficient. Server locators give clients
      dynamic server information and provide server load rebalancing after
      servers depart or join the system.</li>

      <li>High Availability—When a client/server connection receives an
      exception, the connection is automatically failed over to another
      available connection in the pool. Redundancy is also provided for client
      subscriptions.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can alternatively configure a pool statically with a list of
    endpoints. When the pools are statically configured, a round-robin load
    balancing policy is used to distribute connections across the servers.</p>
