  <title>.NET Application Domains</title> 
  <shortdesc>Application domains, or 
	 <codeph>AppDomain</codeph>s, are units of isolation, security boundaries,
	 and loading and unloading for applications in the .NET runtime. Multiple
	 application domains can run in a single process. Each can have one or many
	 threads, and a thread can switch application domains at runtime.
  </shortdesc> 
  <conbody>
	 <note>Before you use application domains with GemFire, make sure you
		understand how to use them generally in your .NET programming.
		<p>The .NET managed assemblies require interface methods invoked by the
		  native C++ layer to be in the same 
		  <codeph>AppDomain</codeph> as that of the .NET DLL. If not, an
		  exception is thrown because the thread is unable to cross 
		  <codeph>AppDomain</codeph> boundaries.
