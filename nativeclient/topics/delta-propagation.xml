    <p id="p_01A422420B7A414193A3FB9218E2DF24">In most distributed data
    management systems, the data stored in the system tends to be created once
    and then updated frequently. These updates are sent to other members for
    event propagation, redundancy management, and cache consistency in
    general. Tracking only the changes in an updated object and sending only
    the updates, or deltas, mean lower network transmission costs and lower
    object serialization/deserialization costs. Performance improvements can
    be significant, especially when changes to an object instance are
    relatively small compared to the overall size of the instance.</p>
