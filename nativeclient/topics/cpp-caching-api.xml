  <title>The C++ Caching API</title> 
  <shortdesc>The native client C++ caching API allows C++ clients to manage
	 data in a vFabric GemFire system. The online C++ API documentation (included in
	 the docs/cppdocs directory of the GemFire native client product installation)
	 provides extensive implementation details for the C++ structures and functions.
	 Several example API programs are included in the SampleCodeDir/examples
	 directory. See Running the Product Examples and QuickStart Guide
