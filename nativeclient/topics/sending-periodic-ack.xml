  <title>Sending Periodic Acknowledgement</title> 
  <shortdesc>When redundancy is enabled for high availability and 
	 <codeph>redundancy-level</codeph> is set to 1 or higher, clients send (and
	 servers expect) periodic acknowledgment messages at configurable intervals for
	 notifications they have received. A periodic ack is not sent by the client if
	 there are no unacknowledged notifications at the time. Servers use this
	 periodic acknowledgment to help reduce the likelihood of sending duplicate
	 notifications, and to reduce resource usage.

		<p> The following system properties in the

		<p>The Pool API also provides attributes to configure periodic ack and
		  duplicate message tracking timeout. See 
		  <codeph>subscription-message-tracking-timeout</codeph> and 
		  <codeph>subscription-ack-interval</codeph> in the list of pool
		  attributes at Configuring Pools for Servers or Locators on page 230.
