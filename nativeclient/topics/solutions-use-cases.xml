      <li id="li_C3E6C74013544EFC901F1FB378627AAD">An application intending to execute a server-side transaction or
      carry out data updates using the GemFire distributed locking
      service.</li>

      <li id="li_5529D2F314554253A0FF989AB460889F">An application wanting to initialize some of its components once on
      each server, which might be used later by executed functions.</li>

      messaging service.</li>

      <li>Any arbitrary aggregation operation that requires iteration over
      local data sets that can be done more efficiently through a single call
      to the cache server.</li>

      <li id="li_9979C4DB1966432EB2652EE8208BD787">Any kind of external resource provisioning that can be done by
