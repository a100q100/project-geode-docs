  <title>Resolving the Error</title> 
  <shortdesc>Each computer where the common language runtime is installed has a
	 machine-wide code cache called the Global Assembly Cache (GAC). The global
	 assembly cache stores assemblies specifically designated to be shared by
	 several applications on the computer. You should share assemblies by installing
	 them into the global assembly cache only when you need to. As a general
	 guideline, keep assembly dependencies private, and locate assemblies in the
	 application directory unless sharing an assembly is explicitly required.
