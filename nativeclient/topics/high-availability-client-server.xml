  <title>High Availability for Client-to-Server Communication</title> 
  <shortdesc> The GemFire native client provides reliable event messaging from
	 cache server to client to prevent data loss during server failover operations.
	 High availability is implemented in the cache server and is configured in the
	 native client. High availability functions the same whether the region is
	 partitioned or not. See the GemFire User's Guide for information about
	 partitioned regions.
  </shortdesc> 
  <conbody>
	 <p> Native clients can specify the number of secondary servers where the
		client registers interest and maintains subscription channels, in addition to
		the subscription channel with the primary server. The secondary servers
		maintain redundant update queues for the client. If the primary server fails,
		one of the secondaries steps in as primary to provide uninterrupted messaging
		to the client. If possible, another secondary is then initialized so the total
		number of secondaries is not reduced by the failover.
	 </p>
	 <p> See the GemFire User's Guide for details about configuring a Java cache
		server for high availability.
