  install OpenSSL</title>

  <shortdesc>This section lists the web sites where you can download OpenSSL,
  and additional packages for each supported platform. For Linux and Solaris,
  you can download the latest tarball archive from the OpenSSL web site at
  <!--BEVLINK-->http://www.openssl.org/source/. Follow these instructions to
  build or install OpenSSL for your specific operating system.</shortdesc>

    <p>Follow these instructions to build or install OpenSSL for your specific
    operating system.</p>

    <section><title>Linux</title>OpenSSL is installed on Linux by default, but
    the OpenSSL development package may need to be installed to successfully
    compile the security templates. <p>To build OpenSSL on Linux, copy the
    downloaded tarball file into
    <codeph>NativeClient_xxxx/templates/security/openssl/Linux</codeph> and
    run <codeph>buildit.sh</codeph>.</p></section>

    <section><title>Solaris</title><p>To build OpenSSL on Solaris, copy the
    downloaded tarball file into
    <codeph>NativeClient_xxxx/templates/security/openssl/SunOS</codeph> and
    run <codeph>buildit.sh</codeph>.</p></section>

    <section><title>Pre-Built OpenSSL (Solaris)</title><p>If you do not want
    to build OpenSSL, you can download a pre-built archive of OpenSSL for
    Solaris at <!--BEVLINK-->http://www.sunfreeware.com/. Follow the links for
    your specific Solaris operating system to download a compatible version of
    OpenSSL and install it. To complete the installation, you may need to
    install some additional listed support files.</p></section>

    <section><title>Windows</title><p>An OpenSSL installer can be downloaded
    for Windows from <!--BEVLINK-->http://www.openssl.org/related/binaries.html
    </p><p>Use the downloaded OpenSSL installer to install it on Windows. You
    can usually accept the default installation path
    (<codeph>C:\OpenSSL</codeph>).</p></section>
