    <p id="p_6DCD900488444522BB44701C6FCEE384">The native client requires an active and valid license to be installed
    on the GemFire servers for full functionality. The product download
    includes a three server evaluation license that allows you to run up to
    three clients for each server. To move into development and production,
    you purchase licenses for your cache servers with add-on licensing for
    your clients. The add-on licensing covers either a specific number of
    clients or unlimited client access. For information, contact technical
    support and see the licensing information in the Java server’s GemFire<i>
    User’s Guide</i>.</p>

    <p>You do not need to install any licenses on the client.</p>

    <p id="p_484B1388ABED40829CD9B238A4504508">If you have any problems with licensing when you run your GemFire
    clients, the errors are logged in the server log files. </p>
