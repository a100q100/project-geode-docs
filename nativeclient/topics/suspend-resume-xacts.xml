    <p id="p_47E885E9454C4902BDFE107BFF4658EC">vFabric GemFire APIs provide the ability to suspend and resume
    transactions.</p>

    <p id="p_AF16D82CCEBF4F19A3D60B5212112203">The ability to suspend and resume is useful when a thread must perform
    some operations that should not be part of the transaction before the
    transaction can complete.</p>

    <p id="p_F4B322265890421FB03569E78A317021">When a transaction is suspended, it loses the transactional view of the
    cache. None of the previous operations (before calling suspend) are
    visible to the thread. Subsequently any operations that are performed by
    the thread do not participate in the suspended transaction.</p>

    <p id="p_716E172661CC44A98BDA5EE78EA881F0">When a transaction is resumed, the resuming thread assumes the
    transactional view. A transaction that is suspending on a member must be
    resumed on the same member. Before resuming a transaction, you may want to
    check if the transaction exists on the member and whether it is suspended.
    You may optionally use the <codeph>tryResume</codeph> method.</p>

    <p id="p_A0566600603045EFB17DD9D894D23990">If the member with the primary copy of the data crashes, the
    transactional view that applied to that data is lost. The secondary member
    for the data will not be able to resume any transactions suspended on the
    crashed member. You will need to take remedial steps to retry the
    transaction on a new primary copy of the data.</p>

    <p>If a suspended transaction is not touched for a period of time, GemFire
    cleans it up automatically. By default, the timeout for a suspended
    transaction is 30 minutes and can be configured by using the
    <codeph>suspended-tx-timeout</codeph> property of the
    <codeph>gfcpp.properties</codeph> file. The suspended transaction timeout
    value is specified in milliseconds.</p>
