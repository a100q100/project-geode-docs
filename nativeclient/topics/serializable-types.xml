  <title> Serializable Types</title> 
  <shortdesc> All of the build-in generics are automatically registered at
	 initialization.
  </shortdesc> 
  <conbody>
	 <p>If your application uses more complex key types that you want to make
		more accessible or easier to handle, you can derive a new class from 
		<codeph>IGFSerializable</codeph>. Another option is for the application
		to do its own object serialization using 
		<codeph>Byte[] 
		</codeph>or a custom type.
	 </p> 
	 <note><xref></xref>The GemFire 
		<codeph>IGFSerializable</codeph> interface does not support object graphs
		with multiple references to the same object. If your application uses these
		types of circular graphs, you must address this design concern explicitly.
