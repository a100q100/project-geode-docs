	<shortdesc><i>Delta Propagation</i> describes how deltas (updates to data) are propagated and
		how to implement delta propagation. It also analyzes performance limitations. </shortdesc>

			stored data is created once and updated frequently. Updates are sent to other members
			for event propagation, redundancy management, and cache consistency in general. Tracking
			only the changes in an updated object and sending only the updates, or deltas, mean
			lower network transmission costs and lower object serialization/deserialization costs.
			Generally, the larger your objects and the smaller the deltas, the greater the
			performance benefits of delta propagation. Partitioned regions generally benefit more
			with higher redundancy levels.
