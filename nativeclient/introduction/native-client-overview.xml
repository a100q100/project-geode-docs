	<title>About the Native Client</title>
	<shortdesc>The native client delivers the full set of capabilities supplied by Java clients
		communicating with a <keyword keyref="product_name"/> server. </shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p id="p_4A91126FAF154FD29836B0EE3314C60E"> The native client is written entirely in C++, so its
			initialization process does not involve the creation of a Java virtual machine. The .NET
			native client provides native operations for the .NET Framework application developer
			who writes in .NET languages and needs to access the <keyword keyref="product_name"/>
			server. </p>
		<p id="p_069EBEFDBE6C473E93BF31F4C8333516">Native clients in C++, Java, and .NET languages
			communicate only with the cache server and do not communicate with each other. The
			native clients interface with the server at the sockets level and implement the same
			wire protocol to the server. These capabilities produce extremely high performance and
			system scalability. </p>
		<p
			id="p_A8D46E04B6B94E6EAF54677522FDC5D5">C++ and .NET native clients provide access to
			the full region API, including support for application plug-ins, managed connectivity,
			highly available data, and reliable failover to a specified server list. All of this is
			transparent to the end user. </p>
		<p id="p_D471203FA236406B8F0BEFCA987E255A">You can configure native clients to cache data locally,
			or they can act in a cacheless mode where they retrieve data from a cache server and
			directly pass it to other system members without incurring the caching overhead. They
			can be configured as read only caches, or be configured to receive notifications from
			the server whenever a key of interest to the client changes on the server. </p>

			C++ applications access the cache server.
