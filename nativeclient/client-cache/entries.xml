	<title>Region Entries</title>
	<shortdesc>Region entries hold cached application data. Entries are automatically managed
		according to region attribute settings. </shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p>You can create, update, invalidate, and destroy entries through explicit API calls or
			through operations distributed from other caches. </p>
		<p> When the number of entries is very large, a partitioned region can provide the required data
			management capacity if the total size of the data is greater than the heap in any single
			JVM.  </p>
		<p>When an entry is created, a new object is instantiated in the region containing: </p>
		<ul
			id="ul_B5282E56FDDD41798380E72E56F974B6">
			<li
				id="li_0D11F7303427416BA80B8B934EFB39F3">The entry key. </li>
			<li id="li_2DF785CAC280414BB419D39A54D0749D">The entry value. This is the application data
				object. The entry value may be set to <codeph>NULL</codeph>, which is the equivalent
				of an invalid value. </li>
		</ul>
		<p>Entry operations invoke callbacks to user-defined application plug-ins. In this chapter,
			the calls that may affect the entry operation itself (by providing a value or aborting
			the operation, for example) are highlighted, but all possible interactions are not
			listed. For details, see <xref
				scope="local"
				href="application-plugins.xml#application-plugins"
				type="concept"
				format="dita">Application Plug-Ins</xref>. </p>
		<p><codeph>DateTime</codeph> objects must be stored in the cache in UTC, so that times
			correspond between client and server. If you use a date with a different time zone,
			convert it when storing into and retrieving from the cache. </p>
