	<shortdesc>You create cache regions either programmatically or through declarative statements in

			<p>The region is the core building block of the <keyword keyref="product_name"/> distributed
				system. All cached data is organized into data regions and you do all of your data
				puts, gets, and querying activities against them.</p>
			<p>A distributed region can be either non-partitioned or a partitioned region. See <xref
					href="../../basic_config/data_regions/chapter_overview.xml"/> for detailed
				descriptions of both non-partitioned and partitioned regions. Region creation is
				subject to attribute consistency checks. The requirements for consistency between
				attributes are detailed both in the online API documentation and throughout the
				discussion of <xref scope="local" href="region-attributes.xml#region-attributes"
