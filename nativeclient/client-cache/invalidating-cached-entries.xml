	<title>Invalidating or Destroying Cached Entries</title>

			<p>Invalidating an entry sets the entry's value to <codeph>NULL</codeph>. Destroying it
				removes the entry from the region altogether. These operations can be carried out in
				the local cache in the following ways: </p>
			<ul
				id="ul_83601BB246924DDA807A3EA099CEC09D">
				<li
					id="li_02A8291990EA460485B47459AC9905B7">Through direct API calls from the
					client. </li>
				<li
					id="li_14409EEFA5E04F219A9E3792768A9A7D">Through expiration activities based on
					the entry's statistics and the region's attribute settings. </li>
			</ul>
				<note>
					<p>A user-defined cache writer is called before an operation is completed, and
					can abort an entry destroy operation.
					</p>
				</note>
			<p>
				
Whether carried out explicitly or through expiration
				activities, invalidation and destruction cause event notification: The
					<codeph>CacheEvent</codeph> object has an <codeph>isExpiration</codeph> flag
				that is set to true for events resulting from expiration activities, and set to
					<codeph>false</codeph> for all other events. </p>
