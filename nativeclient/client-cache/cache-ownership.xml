	<title>Local, Remote, and Distributed Caches</title>
	<shortdesc>The <i>distributed system</i> defines how native client and cache server processes
		find each other. </shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p>The distributed system keeps track of its membership list and makes its members aware of the
			identities of the other members in the distributed system. </p>
		<p>A cache for a native client is referred to as its <i>local cache</i>. All other caches in the
			distributed system are considered <i>remote caches</i> to the application. Every cache
			server and application process has its own cache. The term <i>distributed cache</i> is
			used to describe the union of all caches in a <keyword keyref="product_name"/>
			distributed system. </p>
