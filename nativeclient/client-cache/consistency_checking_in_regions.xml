	<title>Region Consistency</title>
	<shortdesc><keyword keyref="product_name"/> ensures that all copies of a region eventually reach a
		consistent state on all members and clients that host the region. </shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p>By default <keyword keyref="product_name"/> members perform consistency checks when they apply
			updates to a distributed region, in order to ensure that all copies of the region
			eventually become consistent on all <keyword keyref="product_name"/> members and client
			caches that host the region. Different types of region ensure consistency using
			different techniques. However, when consistency checking is enabled (the default) all
			entries in a region require additional overhead in order to store version and timestamp
			information. </p>
		<p>Although a region must have the same consistency checking configuration on all <keyword
				keyref="product_name"/> members that host the region, you can optionally disable
			consistency checking in a client cache region while leaving consistency checking enabled
			for the region on <keyword keyref="product_name"/> members. This configuration may be
			necessary in certain cases where the client must view all updates to a given region,
			even when <keyword keyref="product_name"/> members discards an update in order to
			preserve region consistency. </p>

			<title>Native Client Overhead for Consistency Checks</title>
			<p>In the native client regions, the overhead for performing consistency check is an
				additional 11 bytes per region entry. This overhead is slightly smaller than the
				overhead required to provide consistency checking on server-side region entries. </p>
			<p>If you cannot support the additional overhead in your deployment, you can disable consistency
				checks by setting the region attribute <codeph>concurrency-checks-enabled</codeph>
				to false for each region hosted by your client. </p>
