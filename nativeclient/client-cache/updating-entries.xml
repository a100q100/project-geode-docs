			<p>A cached entry can be updated using these methods: </p>
			<ul
				id="ul_43950A98227C4488B7D2A1D5EE97DBB0">
				<li
					id="li_1BD6BC0E31704034A52973AC296B80FD">Explicitly, when a client invokes a
						<codeph>put</codeph> operation on an existing entry. </li>
				<li id="li_AB6DDC45B2844732928B4DFC230D6454">Implicitly, when a <codeph>get</codeph> is
					performed on an entry that has an invalid value in the cache. An entry can
					become invalid through an explicit API call, through an automated expiration
					action, or by being created with a value of null. </li>
				<li
					id="li_871D1B9F66B3439F8AD6710FD4190292">Automatically, when a new entry value
					is distributed from another cache. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Similar to entry creation, all of these operations can be aborted by a cache writer. </p>
			<p>The <codeph>get</codeph> function returns a direct reference to the entry value
				object. A change made using that reference is called an in-place change because it
				directly modifies the contents of the value in the local cache. For details on safe
				cache access, see <xref
