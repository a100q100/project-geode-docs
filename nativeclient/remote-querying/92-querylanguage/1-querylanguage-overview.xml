	 Considerations for the Native Client</title> 
  <shortdesc>The query language supported in the GemFire native client is
	 essentially a subset of OQL (ODMG 3.0 Object Data Management Group,
	 www.odmg.org ), which is based on SQL-92. The query language provides the basic
	 set of clauses, expressions, and operators used to retrieve elements from
	 objects stored in cache regions.
