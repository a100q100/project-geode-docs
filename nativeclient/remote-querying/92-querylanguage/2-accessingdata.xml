	<shortdesc>Accessing your cached data through the querying service is similar to accessing
		database contents through SQL queries. How you specify your regions and region contents is
		particular to the native client. </shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p>The query language supports drilling down into nested object structures. Regions can
			contain nested data collections that are unavailable until referenced in the FROM
			clause. </p>
		<p>This discussion describes how to navigate to your cached data through the native client
			query service. </p>
			<note>
				<p>Querying and indexing only operate on remote cache server contents.
