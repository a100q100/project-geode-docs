	<shortdesc>The projections in the SELECT projection list are used to transform the results of
		the WHERE search operation. </shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p>You specify the projection list either as * or as a comma delimited list of expressions.
			For *, the interim results of the WHERE clause are returned from the query. Otherwise,
			the set of objects in the interim results are iterated and the projections applied to
			each of the objects. During the application of the projection list, the attributes of
			the objects being traversed are in scope for name resolution. </p>
		<p>
			
You can also specify retrieval of the entry keys in your projection
			list. This allows you to access the associated cached entries for modification and other
			purposes. The following example shows how the Region entry key can be obtained by using
			the region entries in the FROM clause and using appropriate projections. This query runs
			on the /portfolios region, returning a set of <codeph>struct&lt;key:string, id:string,
				secId:string&gt;</codeph> where <codeph>key</codeph> is the key of the region entry,
				<codeph>id</codeph> is an entry ID, and <codeph>secId</codeph> is a secId of a
				<codeph>positionsmap</codeph> for the entry. </p>
		<codeblock>SELECT DISTINCT key, entry.value.id, posnVal.secId

FROM /portfolios.entrySet entry, entry.value.positions.values posnVal

WHERE entry.value."type" = 'xyz' AND posnVal.secId = 'XXX'</codeblock>
