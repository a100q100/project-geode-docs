	<shortdesc>If collections in the <codeph>FROM</codeph> clause are not related to each other, you
		can use the <codeph>WHERE</codeph> clause to join them. </shortdesc>

		<p>The statement below returns all the persons from the <codeph>/Persons</codeph> region
			with the same name as a flower in the <codeph>/Flowers</codeph> region. </p>
		<codeblock>SELECT DISTINCT p FROM /Persons p, /Flowers f WHERE p.name = f.name</codeblock>
		<p>Indexes are supported for region joins. To create indexes for region joins, you create
			single-region indexes for both sides of the join condition. These are used during query
			execution for the join condition. </p>
