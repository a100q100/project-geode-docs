## OOME Thrown:
A member throws an OOME.
There are 2 possibilities:

1. The system is designed such that an OOME doesn't really matter.
That is what this situation covers.

2. An OOME must be avoided.  If OOME occurs then something in the design of the system is wrong.  Redesign and redeploy.

## How the situation manifests (presents):
The member crashes.
Membership kicks out the crashed member,
and the system continues on without that member.

## Action to take:
Notice that the OOME/crash occurred and then (probably) restart the member.
